# Huffman-Lossless-Compression
• Developed a Java program using Huffman coding for lossless file compression, assigning shorter codes to frequent data elements to optimize storage without code overlap

• Applied object-oriented principles for frequency analysis, priority queue management, and tree construction to ensure efficient compression
